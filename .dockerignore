Ignore dependencies, build artifacts, and local environment files
node_modules
.svelte-kit

We must keep the output directory excluded so the COPY command from host to Docker does not fail.
The build/ directory in the build stage is an artifact inside the container.
build/

CRITICAL FIX: Ensure .env is available in the build context for $env/static/private
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The previous build failed because the .env file was missing, leading to no 'build/'
directory and thus causing the subsequent COPY error in the production stage.
We explicitly UN-ignore the required .env file using the negation pattern '!'.
!/.env
